### What I learned

This project was mainly used to further solidify my HTML skills, particularly with making sure I use the correct HTML tags for each section. I haven't had a reason to use the ordered-list tag for most of my other projects up until this point, so that was nice to use. Because of how many list elements there are for this, I'm sure I could have used a more streamlined class system to make the CSS file not be so long, but each list had slightly different properties so I figured I would just make them all separate.
